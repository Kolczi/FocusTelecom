# Project setup

Project is made to be run on local machine. I'm not sure how to make it work on remote machines.

## backend preparation

Change working directory to backend

```
cd ./backend
```

Install all the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Create config.json file in /backend folder and fill it acording to config.json example

## Running backend

Still in /backend directory, run

```
node ./index.js
```

## Frontend preparation

Change working directory to frontend

```
cd ./front
```

Install all the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Create config.json file in /front/src folder and fill it acording to config.json example

## Running frontend

Still in /front directory, run

```
npm run serve
```

## Final step
Upon completion of previous steps, open [frontend app](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser
